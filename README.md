# CAT

This is a small windows WPF program that helps you keep track of everyone's moves and card status while playing Cluedo. It is a better alternative to using a paper and pencil. 

### Improvements that could be made

I originally wanted to be able to find the probabilities of cards being inside the envelope but soon found that a good evaluation function would be extremely difficult to find for Cluedo. I have seen other programs use simulations and contradictions to estimate the probabilities. However, if I were to continue the development of this program, I would probably run it via MCTS since the search space is not too large. I hate WPF (and it has been abandoned by Microsoft) so I will not continue working on this project.
